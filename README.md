## Introduction

**nf-core/dartseq** is a workflow for DART-seq style RNA sequencing analyses with optional RNA editing downstream steps.
It accepts single-end or paired-end FASTQ input, performs read QC and alignment, and can run Bullseye-based
post-processing. Standard outputs include per-sample QC reports, alignments, MultiQC summaries, and optional edited-site tables.

Workflow overview:

1. Parse and validate the input samplesheet.
2. Trim reads with `fastp` or `Trim Galore` (or skip trimming if requested).
3. Run per-sample quality control with [FastQC](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/).
4. Build or use provided aligner references (STAR or HISAT2).
5. Align reads and produce sorted BAM files plus index files.
6. Run optional Bullseye editing analysis:
   parse BAM, summarize sites, quantify edits, compare against controls, and optionally RAC filter / gather sites / GLM.
7. Aggregate run-wide summaries and software versions with [MultiQC](http://multiqc.info/).

## Usage

> [!NOTE]
> If you are new to Nextflow and nf-core, please refer to [this page](https://nf-co.re/docs/get_started/environment_setup/overview) on how to set-up Nextflow. Make sure to [test your setup](https://nf-co.re/docs/get_started/run-your-first-pipeline) with `-profile test` before running the workflow on actual data.

Prepare a samplesheet with at least `sample`, `fastq_1`, and `fastq_2` columns.
For single-end data, leave `fastq_2` empty.

Now, you can run the pipeline using:

```bash
nextflow run nf-core/dartseq \
   -profile <docker/singularity/.../institute> \
   --input samplesheet.csv \
   --outdir <OUTDIR>
```

> [!WARNING]
> Please provide pipeline parameters via the CLI or Nextflow `-params-file` option. Custom config files including those provided by the `-c` Nextflow option can be used to provide any configuration _**except for parameters**_; see [docs](https://nf-co.re/docs/running/run-pipelines#using-parameter-files).

For more details and further functionality, please refer to the [usage documentation](https://nf-co.re/dartseq/usage) and the [parameter documentation](https://nf-co.re/dartseq/parameters).
