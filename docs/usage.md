# nf-core/dartseq: Usage

## :warning: Please read this documentation on the nf-core website: [https://nf-co.re/dartseq/usage](https://nf-co.re/dartseq/usage)

> _Documentation of pipeline parameters is generated automatically from the pipeline schema and can no longer be found in markdown files._

## Introduction

This pipeline supports RNA editing focused processing with Bullseye steps.
For Bullseye runs, ensure that the annotation file matches the reference used for alignment.
For STAR-based alignment with pre-built indices, use `--star_ignore_sjdbgtf` when the index already encodes splice junction annotation.

## Samplesheet input

You will need to create a samplesheet with information about the samples you would like to analyse before running the pipeline. Use this parameter to specify its location. It has to be a comma-separated file with 3 columns, and a header row as shown in the examples below.

```bash
--input '[path to samplesheet file]'
```

### Multiple runs of the same sample

The `sample` identifiers have to be the same when you have re-sequenced the same sample more than once e.g. to increase sequencing depth. The pipeline will concatenate the raw reads before performing any downstream analysis. Below is an example for the same sample sequenced across 3 lanes:

```csv title="samplesheet.csv"
sample,fastq_1,fastq_2
CONTROL_REP1,AEG588A1_S1_L002_R1_001.fastq.gz,AEG588A1_S1_L002_R2_001.fastq.gz
CONTROL_REP1,AEG588A1_S1_L003_R1_001.fastq.gz,AEG588A1_S1_L003_R2_001.fastq.gz
CONTROL_REP1,AEG588A1_S1_L004_R1_001.fastq.gz,AEG588A1_S1_L004_R2_001.fastq.gz
```

### Full samplesheet

The pipeline will auto-detect whether a sample is single- or paired-end using the information provided in the samplesheet. The samplesheet can have as many columns as you desire, however, there is a strict requirement for the first 3 columns to match those defined in the table below.

A final samplesheet file consisting of both single- and paired-end data may look something like the one below. This is for 6 samples, where `TREATMENT_REP3` has been sequenced twice.

```csv title="samplesheet.csv"
sample,fastq_1,fastq_2
CONTROL_REP1,AEG588A1_S1_L002_R1_001.fastq.gz,AEG588A1_S1_L002_R2_001.fastq.gz
CONTROL_REP2,AEG588A2_S2_L002_R1_001.fastq.gz,AEG588A2_S2_L002_R2_001.fastq.gz
CONTROL_REP3,AEG588A3_S3_L002_R1_001.fastq.gz,AEG588A3_S3_L002_R2_001.fastq.gz
TREATMENT_REP1,AEG588A4_S4_L003_R1_001.fastq.gz,
TREATMENT_REP2,AEG588A5_S5_L003_R1_001.fastq.gz,
TREATMENT_REP3,AEG588A6_S6_L003_R1_001.fastq.gz,
TREATMENT_REP3,AEG588A6_S6_L004_R1_001.fastq.gz,
```

| Column    | Description                                                                                                                                                                            |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `sample`  | Custom sample name. This entry will be identical for multiple sequencing libraries/runs from the same sample. Spaces in sample names are automatically converted to underscores (`_`). |
| `fastq_1` | Full path to FastQ file for Illumina short reads 1. File has to be gzipped and have the extension ".fastq.gz" or ".fq.gz".                                                             |
| `fastq_2` | Full path to FastQ file for Illumina short reads 2. File has to be gzipped and have the extension ".fastq.gz" or ".fq.gz".                                                             |

An [example samplesheet](../assets/samplesheet.csv) has been provided with the pipeline.

## Running the pipeline

The typical command for running the pipeline is as follows:

```bash
nextflow run nf-core/dartseq --input ./samplesheet.csv --outdir ./results --genome GRCh37 -profile docker
```

This will launch the pipeline with the `docker` configuration profile. See below for more information about profiles.

Note that the pipeline will create the following files in your working directory:

```bash
work                # Directory containing the nextflow working files
<OUTDIR>            # Finished results in specified location (defined with --outdir)
.nextflow_log       # Log file from Nextflow
# Other nextflow hidden files, eg. history of pipeline runs and old logs.
```

If you wish to repeatedly use the same parameters for multiple runs, rather than specifying each flag in the command, you can specify these in a params file.

Pipeline settings can be provided in a `yaml` or `json` file via `-params-file <file>`.

> [!WARNING]
> Do not use `-c <file>` to specify parameters as this will result in errors. Custom config files specified with `-c` must only be used for [tuning process resource specifications](https://nf-co.re/docs/running/run-pipelines#configuring-pipelines), other infrastructural tweaks (such as output directories), or module arguments (args).

The above pipeline run specified with a params file in yaml format:

```bash
nextflow run nf-core/dartseq -profile docker -params-file params.yaml
```

with:

```yaml title="params.yaml"
input: './samplesheet.csv'
outdir: './results/'
genome: 'GRCh37'
<...>
```

You can also generate such `YAML`/`JSON` files via [nf-core/launch](https://nf-co.re/launch).

## Bullseye Contrasts

The Bullseye DART-seq analysis supports flexible comparison strategies through a contrasts file. This allows you to specify exact sample group comparisons and customize detection parameters per contrast.

### When to use contrasts

Use contrasts when you need:

- **Explicit control** over which groups are compared (e.g., factorial designs)
- **Differential mode** to compare two DART samples (both have editing)
- **Per-contrast thresholds** for different biological contexts

### Contrasts file format

Create a CSV file with these columns:

| Column           | Required | Description                                                    | Default      |
| ---------------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| `contrast_id`    | Yes      | Unique identifier for this comparison                          | -            |
| `edited_group`   | Yes      | Sample group containing editing signal                         | -            |
| `control_group`  | Yes      | Sample group used as control                                   | -            |
| `mode`           | No       | `standard` (DART vs non-DART) or `differential` (DART vs DART) | `standard`   |
| `min_edit`       | No       | Minimum editing percentage to call a site                      | 5 or 3\*     |
| `max_edit`       | No       | Maximum editing percentage (filters noisy sites)               | 90 or 95\*   |
| `fold_threshold` | No       | Fold-change threshold vs control                               | 1.5 or 1.2\* |
| `min_sites`      | No       | Minimum number of edited sites required                        | 3            |

\*Defaults depend on mode: stricter for `standard`, relaxed for `differential`.

### Example: Simple comparison

```csv
contrast_id,edited_group,control_group
baseline_m6A,dart,control
```

### Example: Factorial design

```csv
contrast_id,edited_group,control_group,mode,min_edit,fold_threshold
m6A_noninfected,dart_ni,control_ni,standard,5,1.5
m6A_infected,dart_inf,control_inf,standard,5,1.5
infection_effect,dart_inf,dart_ni,differential,3,1.2
```

In this factorial design:

- First two contrasts detect m6A in non-infected and infected conditions (DART vs non-DART)
- Third contrast finds infection-induced m6A changes (DART vs DART with relaxed thresholds)

### Usage

Provide the contrasts file via the `--bullseye_contrasts` parameter:

```bash
nextflow run nf-core/dartseq \
  --input samplesheet.csv \
  --bullseye_contrasts contrasts.csv \
  --skip_bullseye false \
  ...
```

The `group` column in your samplesheet must match the group names used in the contrasts file.

## Bullseye GLM

After site gathering (`--skip_bullseye_gather_sites false`; skipped by default), the pipeline can fit a generalized linear model across the gathered coverage/mutation matrices to test for differential editing between groups. This step is controlled by `--skip_bullseye_glm` (also skipped by default) and requires `--skip_bullseye_gather_sites false` to have produced the coverage and mutation matrices it reads.

### Observations file

Provide sample metadata via `--bullseye_glm_observations`, a TSV/CSV file with one row per sample and at least:

| Column   | Required | Description                                                                   |
| -------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `sample` | Yes      | Must exactly match a sample column in the gathered coverage/mutation matrices |

Add any further columns needed by your `--bullseye_glm_design` formula (e.g. a `group` column for `~group`). The sample names in the gathered matrices reflect whatever filtering ran immediately before gathering (e.g. `<sample>.bullseye.RAC` if RAC filtering was applied, `<sample>.bullseye.all_sites` if both RAC and AC filtering were skipped) - check the header of `bullseye/all_bullseye_sites/*.bullseye.coverage.txt` to get the exact names to use.

```tsv
sample	group
sample1.bullseye.RAC	dart
sample2.bullseye.RAC	dart
sample3.bullseye.RAC	control
sample4.bullseye.RAC	control
```

### Design and link parameters

- `--bullseye_glm_design` (default `~group`): a one-sided R formula naming the column in the observations file to test. That column is converted to a factor internally, so it does not need to be pre-factored.
- `--bullseye_glm_link` (default `betabin`): the GLM family - `betabin` (beta-binomial, recommended for most editing data), `bin` (binomial), `quasibinomial`, or `betareg`.
- `--bullseye_glm_min_cov` (default `10`): sites with coverage below this threshold (per sample) are zeroed out before fitting.

The design's grouping column needs at least two groups (the GLM stops with an error otherwise); too few samples per group can still yield `NA` p-values for individual sites. Groups are compared against the first group in alphabetical order, and results are reported as `<group>_pvalue` and `<group>_log2FoldChange` per site. Group labels must not occur inside other group or sample names (e.g. groups `k` and `kd`), because Bullseye assigns samples to groups by matching the label.

### Usage

```bash
nextflow run nf-core/dartseq \
  --input samplesheet.csv \
  --skip_bullseye false \
  --skip_bullseye_gather_sites false \
  --skip_bullseye_glm false \
  --bullseye_glm_observations observations.tsv \
  --bullseye_glm_design '~group' \
  --bullseye_glm_link betabin \
  ...
```

### Starting from matrices

If you already have per-site coverage and mutation-count matrices (e.g. from an earlier run, or with additional samples quantified at the same sites), you can run only the GLM. FASTQ processing, alignment and Bullseye site calling are skipped, and `--input` is not needed:

```bash
nextflow run nf-core/dartseq \
  --bullseye_glm_coverage coverage.txt \
  --bullseye_glm_mut mut.txt \
  --bullseye_glm_observations observations.tsv \
  --bullseye_glm_design '~group' \
  --outdir <OUTDIR>
```

Both matrices use the `BULLSEYE_GATHER_SITES` format: tab-delimited, columns `#chr`, `start`, `end`, `cluster`, `strand`, then one column per sample, with identical rows and columns in both files. Every `sample` in the observations file must be a matrix column; extra matrix columns are ignored. Results are written to `bullseye/glm_matrix/glm_matrix.bullseye.glm.tsv`.

### Updating the pipeline

When you run the above command, Nextflow automatically pulls the pipeline code from GitHub and stores it as a cached version. When running the pipeline after this, it will always use the cached version if available - even if the pipeline has been updated since. To make sure that you're running the latest version of the pipeline, make sure that you regularly update the cached version of the pipeline:

```bash
nextflow pull nf-core/dartseq
```

### Reproducibility

It is a good idea to specify the pipeline version when running the pipeline on your data. This ensures that a specific version of the pipeline code and software are used when you run your pipeline. If you keep using the same tag, you'll be running the same version of the pipeline, even if there have been changes to the code since.

First, go to the [nf-core/dartseq releases page](https://github.com/nf-core/dartseq/releases) and find the latest pipeline version - numeric only (eg. `1.3.1`). Then specify this when running the pipeline with `-r` (one hyphen) - eg. `-r 1.3.1`. Of course, you can switch to another version by changing the number after the `-r` flag.

This version number will be logged in reports when you run the pipeline, so that you'll know what you used when you look back in the future. For example, at the bottom of the MultiQC reports.

To further assist in reproducibility, you can use share and reuse [parameter files](#running-the-pipeline) to repeat pipeline runs with the same settings without having to write out a command with every single parameter.

> [!TIP]
> If you wish to share such profile (such as upload as supplementary material for academic publications), make sure to NOT include cluster specific paths to files, nor institutional specific profiles.

## Core Nextflow arguments

> [!NOTE]
> These options are part of Nextflow and use a _single_ hyphen (pipeline parameters use a double-hyphen)

### `-profile`

Use this parameter to choose a configuration profile. Profiles can give configuration presets for different compute environments.

Several generic profiles are bundled with the pipeline which instruct the pipeline to use software packaged using different methods (Docker, Singularity, Podman, Shifter, Charliecloud, Apptainer, Conda) - see below.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> We highly recommend the use of Docker or Singularity containers for full pipeline reproducibility, however when this is not possible, Conda is also supported.

The pipeline also dynamically loads configurations from [https://github.com/nf-core/configs](https://github.com/nf-core/configs) when it runs, making multiple config profiles for various institutional clusters available at run time. For more information and to check if your system is supported, please see the [nf-core/configs documentation](https://github.com/nf-core/configs#documentation).

Note that multiple profiles can be loaded, for example: `-profile test,docker` - the order of arguments is important!
They are loaded in sequence, so later profiles can overwrite earlier profiles.

If `-profile` is not specified, the pipeline will run locally and expect all software to be installed and available on the `PATH`. This is _not_ recommended, since it can lead to different results on different machines dependent on the computer environment.

- `test`
  - A profile with a complete configuration for automated testing
  - Includes links to test data so needs no other parameters
- `docker`
  - A generic configuration profile to be used with [Docker](https://docker.com/)
- `singularity`
  - A generic configuration profile to be used with [Singularity](https://sylabs.io/docs/)
- `podman`
  - A generic configuration profile to be used with [Podman](https://podman.io/)
- `shifter`
  - A generic configuration profile to be used with [Shifter](https://nersc.gitlab.io/development/shifter/how-to-use/)
- `charliecloud`
  - A generic configuration profile to be used with [Charliecloud](https://charliecloud.io/)
- `apptainer`
  - A generic configuration profile to be used with [Apptainer](https://apptainer.org/)
- `wave`
  - A generic configuration profile to enable [Wave](https://seqera.io/wave/) containers. Use together with one of the above (requires Nextflow `24.03.0-edge` or later).
- `conda`
  - A generic configuration profile to be used with [Conda](https://conda.io/docs/). Please only use Conda as a last resort i.e. when it's not possible to run the pipeline with Docker, Singularity, Podman, Shifter, Charliecloud, or Apptainer.

### `-resume`

Specify this when restarting a pipeline. Nextflow will use cached results from any pipeline steps where the inputs are the same, continuing from where it got to previously. For input to be considered the same, not only the names must be identical but the files' contents as well. For more info about this parameter, see [this blog post](https://www.nextflow.io/blog/2019/demystifying-nextflow-resume.html).

You can also supply a run name to resume a specific run: `-resume [run-name]`. Use the `nextflow log` command to show previous run names.

### `-c`

Specify the path to a specific config file (this is a core Nextflow command). See the [nf-core website documentation](https://nf-co.re/usage/configuration) for more information.

## Custom configuration

### Resource requests

Whilst the default requirements set within the pipeline will hopefully work for most people and with most input data, you may find that you want to customise the compute resources that the pipeline requests. Each step in the pipeline has a default set of requirements for number of CPUs, memory and time. For most of the pipeline steps, if the job exits with any of the error codes specified [here](https://github.com/nf-core/rnaseq/blob/4c27ef5610c87db00c3c5a3eed10b1d161abf575/conf/base.config#L18) it will automatically be resubmitted with higher resources request (2 x original, then 3 x original). If it still fails after the third attempt then the pipeline execution is stopped.

To change the resource requests, please see the [max resources](https://nf-co.re/docs/running/configuration/nextflow-for-your-system#set-max-resources) and [customise process resources](https://nf-co.re/docs/running/configuration/nextflow-for-your-system#customize-process-resources) section of the nf-core website.

### Custom Containers

In some cases, you may wish to change the container or conda environment used by a pipeline steps for a particular tool. By default, nf-core pipelines use containers and software from the [biocontainers](https://biocontainers.pro/) or [bioconda](https://bioconda.github.io/) projects. However, in some cases the pipeline specified version maybe out of date.

To use a different container from the default container or conda environment specified in a pipeline, please see the [updating tool versions](https://nf-co.re/docs/running/configuration/nextflow-for-your-system#update-tool-versions) section of the nf-core website.

### Custom Tool Arguments

A pipeline might not always support every possible argument or option of a particular tool used in pipeline. Fortunately, nf-core pipelines provide some freedom to users to insert additional parameters that the pipeline does not include by default.

To learn how to provide additional arguments to a particular tool of the pipeline, please see the [customising tool arguments](https://nf-co.re/docs/running/configuration/nextflow-for-your-system#modifying-tool-arguments) section of the nf-core website.

### nf-core/configs

In most cases, you will only need to create a custom config as a one-off but if you and others within your organisation are likely to be running nf-core pipelines regularly and need to use the same settings regularly it may be a good idea to request that your custom config file is uploaded to the `nf-core/configs` git repository. Before you do this please can you test that the config file works with your pipeline of choice using the `-c` parameter. You can then create a pull request to the `nf-core/configs` repository with the addition of your config file, associated documentation file (see examples in [`nf-core/configs/docs`](https://github.com/nf-core/configs/tree/master/docs)), and amending [`nfcore_custom.config`](https://github.com/nf-core/configs/blob/master/nfcore_custom.config) to include your custom profile.

See the main [Nextflow documentation](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/config.html) for more information about creating your own configuration files.

If you have any questions or issues please send us a message on [Slack](https://nf-co.re/join/slack) on the [`#configs` channel](https://nfcore.slack.com/channels/configs).

## Running in the background

Nextflow handles job submissions and supervises the running jobs. The Nextflow process must run until the pipeline is finished.

The Nextflow `-bg` flag launches Nextflow in the background, detached from your terminal so that the workflow does not stop if you log out of your session. The logs are saved to a file.

Alternatively, you can use `screen` / `tmux` or similar tool to create a detached session which you can log back into at a later time.
Some HPC setups also allow you to run nextflow within a cluster job submitted your job scheduler (from where it submits more jobs).

## Nextflow memory requirements

In some cases, the Nextflow Java virtual machines can start to request a large amount of memory.
We recommend adding the following line to your environment to limit this (typically in `~/.bashrc` or `~./bash_profile`):

```bash
NXF_OPTS='-Xms1g -Xmx4g'
```
